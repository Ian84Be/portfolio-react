            I am a full-stack web developer with strong front-end skills and
            military leadership experience. My specialties include Javascript,
            React, Redux, Node, Express, HTML, and CSS.

            I have spent the last year studying and building projects with
            JavaScript at Lambda School. It has been an intense and rewarding
            experience to say the least. I was also hired by Lambda School to be
            a Team Lead. My role was to manage, mentor, and guide a group of new
            students through their first 16 weeks of learning.

            When I am not staring into screens I like to play guitar, cook food,
            read books, and go outside, sometimes in that exact order.
